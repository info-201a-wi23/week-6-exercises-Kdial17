Here's a plot of average IMDB rating for each season of The Office.
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load library
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("tidyverse")

# Load The Office data from this URL:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/TheOfficeIMDBPerEpisode.csv
# This data is drawn from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapastor/the-office-imdb-ratings-per-episode
office_df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/Neat-Datasets/main/TheOfficeIMDBPerEpisode.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Which season of The Office was the best?
# Calculate the average IMDB rating for each season
rating_per_season <- office_df %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE))

# Now plot the average IMDB rating for each season as a scatterplot, a line plot, or both
# Your ggplot code here
ggplot(data = rating_per_season) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Season, y = avg_rating))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Find the highest IMDB rating for any episode of The Office and pull the value
highest_rating <- office_df %>% summarize(max_rating = max(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull(max_rating)

# Find the lowest IMDB rating for any episode of The Office and pull the value
lowest_rating <- office_df %>% summarize(min_rating = min(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% pull(min_rating)
```
The highest IMDB rating for any episode of The Office is `r highest_rating`, and the lowest rating is `r lowest_rating`.
